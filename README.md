Build a trending movie app using React.js, Router, and Redux for state management. Ideally this works on the latest Chrome, FF, Safari, and Edge browsers (IE11 is a bonus).

## On the "Home" tab

You'll be using the Trakt API to list the top 20 trending movies, using the movie poster as the display item.

The list layout should be adaptive/responsive - from single column for small device, double for medium, and up to 3 columns max (you define the sizes).

The information to display for each movie besides the poster image is:

* Name of the movie
* Year it was released
* A button/icon should be available for each movie that allows me to save the movie to my favorites.

If a movie has been saved to my favorites, the icon should reflect as such (hollow heart vs filled heart?), and allow me to remove it.

## On the "Favorites" tab

Very similar to the "Home" tab, but just shows things that were favorited. This can also allow me to remove items.
